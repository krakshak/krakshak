## About Me
In my role at [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/), I led a fraud detection project that automated feature creation, algorithm optimization, and visualization for Supplemental Fraud SAR risk scoring. This work saved 20 FTE investigators‚Äô effort and nearly $1M in operational costs while achieving a ROC-AUC score of 0.8. My contributions went beyond technical implementation by effectively communicating results to cross-functional teams, and turning complex data insights into actionable strategies. Formerly a <b>Data Scientist</b> at [Dataweave](https://dataweave.com/), an e-commerce analytics company for 3+ years. In this role, I was initially involved in <b>Data scraping and Data Wrangling</b> from major e-commerce websites. As I progressed, I transitioned into <b>automating data science and ML workflows</b> using technologies like <b>Apache Airflow</b>, <b>MLFLow</b>, <b>Amazon Web Services</b>, <b>Docker</b> and <b>CI/CD workflows</b>. This hands-on experience allowed me to witness the direct application of Data Science in solving real-world problems.

I completed my graduate degree (Master of Science in Data Science) from [Northeastern University](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/computer-information-science/computer-science/data-science-ms/#programrequirementstext) with a 4.0 GPA. My research interests include Neural Networks and Large Language Models. I completed my undergraduate in Information Science Engineering at [BMS College of Engineering](https://www.bmsce.ac.in/), graduating in the <b>top 10%</b> of the class of 2020. At BMSCE, I was a <b>senior coordinator</b> for the ISE Student Club and served as the <b>Technical mentor</b> between 2019-2020. From a cultural standpoint, I served as the <b>Coordinator and Head</b> of the publicity and sponsorship teams for the BMSCE‚Äôs annual technical symposium, PhaseShift, between 2018-2019.

Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy staying active and exploring the outdoors. Whether it's playing badminton or embarking on a scenic trail hike, I find solace in the balance between mental and physical well-being. Also, I find immense joy in immersing myself within captivating story-driven games, where I often happily venture into virtual worlds, indulging in epic gaming adventures.

Looking ahead, I am eager to combine the comprehensive skills in Data Science, encompassing Machine Learning, Statistics, and Algorithms, that I have acquired at the university with my prior industry experience. My ultimate goal is to tackle complex <b>real-world data science problems</b> and make a meaningful impact.  

Fall 2024:
* DS5500: Data Science Capstone.
