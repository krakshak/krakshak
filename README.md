Hi 👋 My name is Rakshak Kunchum
================================

Data Science Graduate Student at Northeastern University
--------------------------------------------------------

Formerly a Data Engineer at Dataweave, an e-commerce analytics company for 2.5 years. n this role, I was initially involved in Data scraping and Data Wrangling from major e-commerce websites. As I progressed, I transitioned into automating data workflows using technologies like Airflow and Amazon Web Services. This hands-on experience allowed me to witness the direct application of Data Science in solving real-world problems.

Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy staying active and exploring the outdoors. Whether it's playing badminton or embarking on a scenic trail hike, I find solace in the balance between mental and physical well-being. Also, I find immense joy in immersing myself within captivating story-driven games, where I often happily venture into virtual worlds, indulging in epic gaming adventures.

Looking ahead, I am eager to combine the comprehensive skills in Data Science, encompassing Machine Learning, Statistics, and Algorithms, that I am acquiring at the university with my prior industry experience. My ultimate goal is to tackle complex real-world data science problems and make a meaningful impact.
